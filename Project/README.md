# Project
## User Guide
This project is basically a hall effect keyboard prototype with additional sensors, a display and a servo strapped onto.
I wanted to do this project due to the fact that hall effect switches have several large advantages over the popular mechanical designs and convinced my group partner Fabian to choose this as our project.
